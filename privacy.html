      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This privacy policy applies to the FRC 7598 app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was
        created by Avexel Web Design (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended
        for use "AS IS".
      </p>

      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
      <p>The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include information such as</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
        <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages</li>
        <li>The time spent on the Application</li>
        <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>
      <p>
        The Application collects your device's location, which helps the Service Provider determine your approximate
        geographical location and make use of in below ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Geolocation Services:</strong> personalized content, relevant recommendations, and location-based services.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics and Improvements:</strong> analyze user behavior, identify trends, and improve the Application.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> anonymized location data to external services to enhance the Application.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions.</p>
      <p>For a better experience, the Service Provider may require certain personally identifiable information, retained and used as described in this policy.</p>

      <h2>Third Party Access</h2>
      <p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid in improving the Application and service.</p>
      <p>The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>as required by law (e.g., subpoena or similar legal process);</li>
        <li>to protect rights/safety, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;</li>
        <li>with trusted service providers under this privacy statement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
      <p>You can stop all collection of information by uninstalling the Application using your device or app marketplace processes.</p>

      <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
      <p>The Service Provider will retain User Provided data while you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. To request deletion, email <a href="mailto:contact@avexel.co">contact@avexel.co</a>.</p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>The Service Provider does not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 13 and encourages parental supervision.</p>
      <p>If you believe a child has provided personally identifiable information, contact <a href="mailto:contact@avexel.co">contact@avexel.co</a> so necessary actions can be taken. You must be at least 16 to consent to processing in your country (or have a guardian do so where permitted).</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information processed and maintained.</p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated. Updates will be reflected on this page. Continued use is deemed approval of changes.</p>
      <p><em>Effective as of 2025-08-24</em></p>

      <h2>Your Consent</h2>
      <p>By using the Application, you consent to the processing of your information as set forth herein, now and as amended.</p>
